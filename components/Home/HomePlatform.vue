          Massbit platform incentivizes the community to run workers for doing the same tasks. That is to avoid the
          single point of failure and the incentives are to make sure they all behave well. Participants have to stake
          MBT tokens and do the work properly to get rewards. Otherwise, they will get slashed and lose their staked MBT
          tokens
